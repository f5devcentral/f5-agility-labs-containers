Lab 1.2 - Deploy Hello-World Using Route
========================================

Now that CIS is up and running, let's deploy an application and leverage CIS.

For this lab we'll use a simple pre-configured docker image called
"f5-hello-world". It can be found on docker hub at
`f5devcentral/f5-hello-world <https://hub.docker.com/r/f5devcentral/f5-hello-world/>`_

To deploy our application, we will need the following definitions:

- Define the **Deployment** resource: this will launch our application running
  in a container.

- Define the **Service** resource: this is an abstraction which defines a
  logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Expose the service
  on a port on each node of the cluster (the same port on each node). Youâ€™ll
  be able to contact the service on any <NodeIP>:NodePort address. When you set
  the type field to "NodePort", the master will allocate a port from a
  flag-configured range (default: 30000-32767), and each Node will proxy that
  port (the same port number on every Node) for your Service.

- Define the **Route** resource: this is used to add the necesary annotations
  to define the virtual server settings.

App Deployment
--------------

Back on **okd-master1** we will create all the required
files:

#. Go back to the Web Shell session you opened in a previous task. If you need to open a new
   session go to the **Deployment** tab of your UDF lab session at https://udf.f5.com 
   to connect to **okd-master1** using the **Web Shell** access method, then switch to the **centos** 
   user account using the "**su**" command:

   .. image:: ../images/OKDWEBSHELL.png

   .. image:: ../images/OKDWEBSHELLroot.png

   .. code-block:: bash

      su centos

#. Create a file called ``deployment-hello-world.yaml``

   .. tip:: Use the file in ~/agilitydocs/docs/class2/openshift

   .. literalinclude:: ../openshift/deployment-hello-world.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :caption: deployment-hello-world.yaml
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 2,7,20

#. Create a file called ``nodeport-service-hello-world.yaml``

   .. tip:: Use the file in ~/agilitydocs/docs/class2/openshift

   .. literalinclude:: ../openshift/nodeport-service-hello-world.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :caption: nodeport-service-hello-world.yaml
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 2,17

#. Create a file called ``route-hello-world.yaml``

   .. tip:: Use the file in ~/agilitydocs/docs/class2/openshift

   .. literalinclude:: ../openshift/route-hello-world.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :caption: route-hello-world.yaml
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 2,7-9,23,24

#. We can now launch our application:

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc create -f deployment-hello-world.yaml
      oc create -f nodeport-service-hello-world.yaml
      oc create -f route-hello-world.yaml

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-launch-app-route.png

#. To check the status of our deployment, you can run the following commands:

   .. note:: This can take a few seconds to a minute to create these
      hello-world containers to running state.

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc get pods -o wide

   .. image:: ../images/f5-hello-world-pods-route.png

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc describe svc f5-hello-world

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-check-app-definition-route.png

   .. attention:: To understand and test the new app pay attention to the
      **NodePort value**, that's the port used to give you access to the app
      from the outside. In this example it's "30459", highlighted above.

#. Now that we have deployed our application sucessfully, we can check the
   configuration on BIG-IP1. Go back to the TMUI session you opened in a previous task. If you need to open a new
   session go back to the **Deployment** tab of your UDF lab session at https://udf.f5.com 
   and connect to **BIG-IP1** using the **TMUI** access method (*username*: **admin** and *password*: **admin**)

   .. image:: ../images/TMUI.png

   .. image:: ../images/TMUILogin.png

   Browse to :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Virtual Servers`

   .. warning:: Don't forget to select the "okd" partition or you'll see
      nothing.

   With "*Route*" you'll seee two virtual servers defined. "**okd_http_vs**" and
   "**okd_https_vs**", listening on port **80** and **443**.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-check-app-route-bigipconfig.png

   These Virtuals use an LTM Policy to direct traffic based on the host header.
   You can view this from the BIG-IP GUI at :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Policies`
   and click :menuselection:`Published Policy --> "openshift_insecure_routes"`

   .. image:: ../images/f5-check-ltm-policy-route.png

#. Check the Pools to see a new pool and the associated pool members.

   Browse to: :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Pools` and select the
   "openshift_default_f5-hello-world-web" pool. Click the Members tab.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-check-app-route-pool.png

   .. note:: You can see that the pool members listed are all the cluster
      node IPs on port 30459. (**NodePort mode**)

#. Access your web application via **Firefox** on the **superjump**.

   .. note:: Open a new tab and select the "mysite.f5demo.com" shortcut or type
      http://mysite.f5demo.com in the URL field.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-access-app.png

#. Delete Hello-World

   .. important:: Do not skip this step. Instead of reusing some of these
      objects, the next lab we will re-deploy them to avoid conflicts and
      errors.

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc delete -f route-hello-world.yaml
      oc delete -f nodeport-service-hello-world.yaml
      oc delete -f deployment-hello-world.yaml

   .. attention:: Validate the objects are removed via the management console.
