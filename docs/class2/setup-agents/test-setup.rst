Test your setup
===============

Launch a command
----------------

Connect to Marathon through one of the master (:8080) and launch an application

#.  Click on *create application*

    .. image:: /_static/class2/setup-slave-test-create-application-button.png
       :align: center

#.  ID: Test
    CPU: 0.1
    Memory : 32M
    Command: echo Test; sleep 10

#.  Click on *Create Application*

       :align: center

Once it runs, if you connect to the mesos framework, you should see more and
more completed tasks. Name of the task should be "Test" (our ID).

If you let it run for a while, you'll see more and more "Completed Tasks". You
can see that the Host being selected to run those tasks is not always the same.

Go Back to Marathon, click on our application *test* and click on the setting
button and select *destroy* to remove it.

Launch a container
------------------

To test our containers from marathon, click on create an application, switch
to JSON mode and use the following to start an apache in a container


.. NOTE:: This may takes some time since we will have to retrieve the image
   first

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "id": "my-website",
     "cpus": 0.5,
     "mem": 32.0,
     "container": {
       "type": "DOCKER",
       "docker": {
         "image": "eboraas/apache-php",
         "network": "BRIDGE",
         "portMappings": [
           { "containerPort": 80, "hostPort": 0 }
         ]
       }
     }
   }

It may take some time to switch from ``Deploying`` to ``Running``. Once it's
in a ``Running`` state, check the port used by the container and try to access
it (slave ``IP:port``)

.. image:: /_static/class2/setup-slave-test-create-container-run.png
   :align: center

Click on your application and here you'll see the port associated to your
instance (here it is ``31755``) and on which host it run
(here slave1 - ``10.1.20.51``)
