Lab 3.2 - F5 Container Connector Usage
======================================

Now that our container connector is up and running, let's deploy an application and leverage our F5 CC.

For this lab we'll use a simple pre-configured docker image called "f5-hello-world". It can be found on docker hub at `f5devcentral/f5-hello-world <https://hub.docker.com/r/f5devcentral/f5-hello-world/>`_

To deploy our application, we will need to do the following:

#. Define a Deployment: this will launch our application running in a container.

#. Define a ConfigMap: this can be used to store fine-grained information like individual properties or coarse-grained information like entire config files or JSON blobs. It will contain the BIG-IP configuration we need to push.

#. Define a Service: this is an abstraction which defines a logical set of *pods* and a policy by which to access them. Expose the *service* on a port on each node of the cluster (the same port on each *node*). Youâ€™ll be able to contact the service on any <NodeIP>:NodePort address. If you set the type field to "NodePort", the Kubernetes master will allocate a port from a flag-configured range **(default: 30000-32767)**, and each Node will proxy that port (the same port number on every Node) into your *Service*.

App Deployment
--------------

On the **master** we will create all the required files:

#. Create a file called ``f5-hello-world-deployment.yaml``

    .. tip:: Use the file in /home/ubuntu/f5-kube-demo

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../kubernetes/f5-hello-world-deployment.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 2,14

#. Create a file called ``f5-hello-world-configmap.yaml``

    .. tip:: Use the file in /home/ubuntu/f5-kube-demo

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../kubernetes/f5-hello-world-configmap.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 2,9,16,18

#. Create a file called ``f5-hello-world-service.yaml``

    .. tip:: Use the file in /home/ubuntu/f5-kube-demo

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../kubernetes/f5-hello-world-service.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 2,12

#. We can now launch our application:

    .. code-block:: bash

        kubectl create -f f5-hello-world-deployment.yaml
        kubectl create -f f5-hello-world-configmap.yaml
        kubectl create -f f5-hello-world-service.yaml

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-launch-app.png
        :align: center

#. To check the status of our deployment, you can run the following commands:

    .. code-block:: bash

        kubectl get pods

    .. image:: images/f5-hello-world-pods.png
        :align: center

    .. code-block:: bash

        kubectl describe svc f5-hello-world
        
    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-check-app-definition.png
        :align: center

#. To test the app you need to pay attention to:

    **The NodePort value**, that's the port used by Kubernetes to give you access to the app from the outside. Here it's "30507", highlighted above.
    
    **The Endpoints**, that's our 2 instances (defined as replicas in our deployment file) and the port assigned to the service: port 8080.

    Now that we have deployed our application sucessfully, we can check our BIG-IP configuration.  From the browser open https://10.1.1.245

    .. warning:: Don't forget to select the "kubernetes" partition or you'll see nothing.

    Here you can see a new Virtual Server, "default_f5-hello-world" was created, listening on 10.1.10.81.

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-check-app-bigipconfig.png
        :align: center

    Check the Pools to see a new pool and the associated pool members: Local Traffic --> Pools --> "cfgmap_default_f5-hello-world_f5-hello-world" --> Members

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-check-app-bigipconfig2.png
        :align: center

    .. note:: You can see that the pool members listed are all the kubernetes nodes. (**NodePort mode**)

#. Now you can try to access your application via your BIG-IP VIP: 10.1.10.81

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-access-app.png
        :align: center

#. Hit Refresh many times and go back to your **BIG-IP** UI, go to Local Traffic > Pools > Pool list > cfgmap_default_f5-hello-world_f5-hello-world > Statistics to see that traffic is distributed as expected.

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-check-app-bigip-stats.png
        :align: center

#. How is traffic forwarded in Kubernetes from the <node IP>:30507 to the <container IP>:8080? This is done via iptables that is managed via the kube-proxy instances. On either of the nodes, ssh in and run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo iptables-save | grep f5-hello-world

    This will list the different iptables rules that were created regarding our service.
