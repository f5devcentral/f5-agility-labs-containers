Lab 2.3 - Deploy Hello-World Using ConfigMap w/ AS3
===================================================

Just like the previous lab we'll deploy the f5-hello-world docker container.
But instead of using the Route resource we'll use ConfigMap.

App Deployment
--------------

On **okd-master1** we will create all the required files:

#. Create a file called ``deployment-hello-world.yaml``

   .. tip:: Use the file in ~/agilitydocs/docs/class2/openshift

   .. literalinclude:: ../openshift/deployment-hello-world.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :caption: deployment-hello-world.yaml
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 2,7,20

#. Create a file called ``f5-hello-world-service-cluster.yaml``

   .. tip:: Use the file in ~/agilitydocs/docs/class2/openshift

   .. literalinclude:: ../openshift/clusterip-service-hello-world.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :caption: clusterip-service-hello-world.yaml
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 2,8-10,17

#. Create a file called ``configmap-hello-world.yaml``

   .. tip:: Use the file in ~/agilitydocs/docs/class2/openshift

   .. literalinclude:: ../openshift/configmap-hello-world.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :caption: configmap-hello-world.yaml
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 2,5,7,8,27,30

#. We can now launch our application:

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc create -f deployment-hello-world.yaml
      oc create -f clusterip-service-hello-world.yaml
      oc create -f configmap-hello-world.yaml

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-launch-app.png

#. To check the status of our deployment, you can run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc get pods -o wide

   .. image:: ../images/f5-okd-hello-world-pods.png

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc describe svc f5-hello-world

   .. image:: ../images/f5-okd-check-app-definition.png

   .. attention:: To understand and test the new app pay attention to the
      **Endpoints value**,  this shows our 2 instances (defined as replicas in
      our deployment file) and the overlay network IP assigned to the pod.

#. Now that we have deployed our application sucessfully, we can check the
   configuration on BIG-IP1. Switch back to the open management session on
   firefox.

   .. warning:: Don't forget to select the proper partition. Previously we
      checked the "*okd*" partition. In this case we need to look at the "**AS3**"
      partition. This partition was auto created by AS3 and named after the
      Tenant which happens to be "**AS3**".

   Browse to: :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Virtual Servers`

   Here you can see a new Virtual Server, "**serviceMain**" was created,
   listening on **10.1.1.4:80** in partition "**AS3**".

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-check-app-bigipconfig-as3.png

#. Check the Pools to see a new pool and the associated pool members.

   Browse to: :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Pools` and select the
   "**web_pool**" pool. Click the **Members** tab.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-check-app-web-pool-as3.png

   .. note:: You can see that the pool members IP addresses are assigned from
      the overlay network (**ClusterIP mode**)

#. Access your web application via **Firefox** on the **superjump**.

   .. note:: Select the "Hello, World" shortcut or type http://10.1.1.4 in the
      URL field.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-access-app.png

#. Hit Refresh many times and go back to your **BIG-IP** UI.

   Browse to: :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Pools --> Pool list -->
   "web_pool" --> Statistics` to see that traffic is distributed as expected.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-okd-check-app-bigip-stats-clusterip.png

   .. note:: Why is all the traffic directed to one pool member? The answer can
      be found by instpecting the "serviceMain" virtual service in the
      management GUI.

#. Scale the f5-hello-world app

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc scale --replicas=10 deployment/f5-hello-world-web -n default

#. Check that the pods were created

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc get pods

   .. image:: ../images/f5-hello-world-pods-scale10-2.png

#. Check the pool was updated on BIG-IP1. Browse to: :menuselection:`Local Traffic
   --> Pools` and select the "web_pool" pool. Click the Members tab.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-hello-world-pool-scale10-clusterip.png

   .. attention:: Now we show 10 pool members. In module1 the number stayed at
      3 and didn't change, why?

#. Remove Hello-World from BIG-IP.

   .. attention:: In older versions of AS3 a "blank AS3 declaration" was
      required to completely remove the application/declaration from BIG-IP. In
      AS3 v2.20 and newer this is no longer a requirement.

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc delete -f configmap-hello-world.yaml
      oc delete -f clusterip-service-hello-world.yaml
      oc delete -f deployment-hello-world.yaml

   .. note:: Be sure to verify the virtual server and "AS3" partition were
      removed from BIG-IP.

.. attention:: This concludes **Class 2 - CIS and OpenShift**. Feel free to
   experiment with any of the settings. The lab will be destroyed at the end of
   the class/day.
