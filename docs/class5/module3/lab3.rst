Module 3: Container Connector in Action
=======================================

This section of the lab will cover creating OpenShift resources that the F5 Container Connector will process and use to update the BIG-IP configuration and leverages the work you did in the previous sections.

Operational Overview
---------------------
The Container Connector watches for events being generated by the Openshift API server and takes action when it sees an OpenShift ConfigMap or Route resource that has an F5-specific label defined.  The Container Connector parses the ConfigMap or Route resource
and updates the BIG-IP configuration to match the desired state as defined by those resources.

In addition to watching and responding to events in realtime, the Container Connector periodically queries the OpenShift API for the current status and updates the BIG-IP as needed.  This interval (verify-interval) is 30 seconds by default but is a startup value that can be modified.

An instance of the Container Connector can watch for changes in all namespaces (projects), a single namespace or a discrete list of namespaces.  Additionally, an instance of the Container Connector is configured to make configuration changes in a single non-Common BIG-IP partition.

OpenShift runs on top of Kubernetes and the same Container Connector works for both, but many of the Container Connector features apply to both while some apply only to OpenShift, like Routes, while others, like Ingress, apply only to Kubernetes.

You can find detailed information about configuring, deploying and using the F5 Container Connector as well as configuration options for ConfigMaps and Routes
https://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/#

Additionally, you can get more detailed information about an OpenShift command by using **oc <command> -help**.  So, for example, if you wanted to find out more about the **oc create** command, you would do the following:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 garrison]# oc create -help

In the following exercises, you will create the following OpenShift resource types:

* ConfigMaps
* Routes

Additionally, you will also create variations of each resource type.

.. NOTE:: 

    You will use the same Windows jumpbox as you used in the previous sections to complete the exercises in this section.

    Unless otherwise noted, all the resource definition yaml files have been pre-created and can be found on the ose-master server under **/root/agility2018/apps/module3**

Exercise 1: ConfigMap - Basic
-----------------------------

An OpenShift ConfigMap is one of the resource types that the F5 Container Connector watches for.  The Container Connector will read the ConfigMap
and create a virtual server, node(s), a pool, pool member(s) and a pool health monitor.

In this exercise, you will create a ConfigMap that defines the objects that the Container Connector should configure on the BIG-IP.

To complete this exercise, you will perform the following steps:

* Step 1: Deploy demo application
* Step 2: Create a service to expose the demo application
* Step 3: Create a ConfigMap that declares desired BIG-IP configuration
* Step 4: Review the BIG-IP configuration
* Step 5: Test the application
* Step 6: Scale the application
* Step 7: Test the scaled application
* Step 8: Cleanup deployed resources

**Step 1**: Deploy demo application

From ose-master, review the following Deployment configuration: f5-demo-app-deployment.yaml

.. literalinclude:: ../../../openshift/advanced/apps/module3/f5-demo-app-deployment.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 2,4,7

Now that you have reviewed the Deployment,you need to actually create the Deployment by deploying it to OpenShift by using the **oc create** command.

From ose-master server, run the following command:

.. attention:: Be sure to change working directory on ose-mstr01:

    cd /root/agility2018/apps/module3

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 module3]# oc create -f f5-demo-app-deployment.yaml
    deployment "f5-demo-app" created

**Step 2:** Create Service to expose application

In order for an application to be accessible outside of the OpenShift cluster, a Service must be created.  The Service uses a label selector to reference the application to be exposed.  Additionally, the service also specifies the container port (8080) that the application is listening on.

From ose-master, review the following Service: f5-demo-app-service.yaml

.. literalinclude:: ../../../openshift/advanced/apps/module3/f5-demo-app-service.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 2,4,9

Now that you have reviewed the Service,you need to actually create the Service by deploying it to OpenShift by using the **oc create** command.

From ose-master server, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 module3]# oc create -f f5-demo-app-service.yaml
    service "f5-demo-app" created

**Step 3:** Create ConfigMap

A ConfigMap is used to define the BIG-IP objects that need to be created to enable access to the application via the BIG-IP.

The label, **f5type: virtual-server**, in the ConfigMap definition is what triggers the F5 Container Connector to process this ConfigMap.

In addition to the label, there are several F5-specific sections defined:

* **virtualServer:** Beginning of F5-specific configuration
* **backend:** Represents the server-side of the virtual server definition
* **healthMonitors:** Health monitor definition for the pool
* **frontend:** Represents the client-side of the virtual server
* **virtualAddress:** IP address and port of virtual server

A **ConfigMap** points to a **Service** which points to one or more **Pods** where the application is running.

From ose-master, review the ConfigMap resource f5-demo-app-configmap.yaml

.. literalinclude:: ../../../openshift/advanced/apps/module3/f5-demo-app-configmap.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 1,5,14,34,36

.. attention:: *Knowledge Check: How does the BIG-IP know which pods make up the application?*

Now that you have reviewed the ConfigMap, you need to actually create the ConfigMap by deploying it to OpenShift by using the **oc create** command:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 module3]# oc create -f f5-demo-app-configmap.yaml
    configmap "f5-demo-app" created

**Step 4:** Review BIG-IP configuration

In this step, you will examine the BIG-IP configuration that was created by the Container Connector when it processed the ConfigMap created in the previous step.

Launch the Chrome browser and click on the bookmark named **bigip01.f5.local** to access the BIG-IP GUI:

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-bookmark.png
    :align: center

From the BIG-IP login page, enter username=admin and password=admin and click the **Log in** button:

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-login-page.png
    :align: center

Navigate to **Local Traffic --> Network Map** and change the partition to **ocp** using the dropdown in the upper right.  The network map view shows a virtual server, pool and pool member. All of these objects were created by the Container Connector using the declarations defined in the ConfigMap.

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-network-map-cfgmap.png
    :align: center

.. attention:: *Knowledge Check: In the network map view, what OpenShift object type does the pool member IP address represent?  How was the IP address assigned?*

To view the IP address of the virtual server, hover your cursor over the name of the virtual server:

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-vs-ip-hover.png
    :align: center

.. attention:: *Knowledge Check: What OpenShift resource type was used to define the virtual server IP address?*

**Step 5:** Test the application

In this step, you will use the Chrome browser to access the application you previously deployed to OpenShift.

Open a new browser tab and enter the IP address assigned to the virtual server in to the address bar:

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/f5-demo-app-url.png
    :align: center

.. note:: On the application page, the **Server IP** is the pool member (pod) IP address; the **Server Port** is the port of the virtual server; and the **Client IP** is the IP address of the Windows jumpbox you are using.

**Step 6:** Scale the application

The application deployed in step #1 is a single replica (instance).  In this step,you are going to increase the number of replicas and then check the BIG-IP configuration to see what's changed.

When the deployment replica count is scaled up or scaled down, an OpenShift event is generated and the Container Connector sees the event and adds or removes pool members as appropriate.

To scale the number of replicas, you will use the OpenShift **oc scale** command.  You will be scaling the demo app deployment and so You first need to get the name of the deployment.

From ose-master, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 module3]# oc get deployment -n f5demo
    NAME          DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    f5-demo-app   1         1         1            1           1m

You can see from the output that the deployment is named **f5-demo-app**.  You will use that name for the next command.

From the ose-master host, entering the following command to set the replica count for the deployment to 10 instances:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 module3]# oc scale --replicas=10 deployment/f5-demo-app -n f5demo
    deployment "f5-demo-app" scaled

**Step 7:** Review the BIG-IP configuration

In this step, you will examine the BIG-IP configuration for changes that occured after the application was scaled up.

Navigate to **Local Traffic --> Network Map** and change the partition to **ocp** using the dropdown in the upper right.

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-network-map-scaled.png
    :align: center

.. attention:: *Knowledge Check: How many pool members are shown in the network map view?  What do you think would happen if you scaled the deployment back to one replica?*

**Step 8:** Test the scaled application

In this step, you will use the Chrome browser to access the application that you scaled to 10 replicas in the previous step.

Open a new Chrome browser tab and enter the IP address assigned to the virtual server in to the address bar:

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/f5-demo-app-url.png
    :align: center

If you reload the page every few seconds, you should see the **Server IP** address change.  Because there is more than one instance of the application running, the BIG-IP load balances the application traffic amongst multiple pods.  

**Step 9:** Cleanup deployed resources

In this step, you will remove the OpenShift Deployment, Service and ConfigMap resources you created in the previous steps using the OpenShift **oc delete** command.

From ose-master server, issue the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 tmp]# oc delete -f f5-demo-app-configmap.yaml
    configmap "f5-demo-app" deleted

    [root@ose-mstr01 tmp]# oc delete -f f5-demo-app-deployment.yaml
    deployment "f5-demo-app" deleted

    [root@ose-mstr01 module3]# oc delete -f f5-demo-app-service.yaml
    service "f5-demo-app" deleted   

Exercise 2: Route - Basic
-------------------------

An OpenShift Route is one of the resource types that the F5 Container Connector watches for.  A Route defines a hostname or URI mapping to an application.  For example, the hostname "customer.example.com" could map to the application "customer", hostname "catalog.example.com", might map to the application "catalog", etc.

Similarily, a Route can refer to a URI path so, for example, the URI path "/customer" might map to the application called "customer" and URI path "/catalog",
might map to the application called "catalog".  If a Route only specifies URI paths, the Route applies to all HTTP request hostnames.

Additionally, a Route can refer to both a hostname and a URI path such as mycompany.com/customer or mycompany.com/catalog

The F5 Container Connector reads the Route resource and creates a virtual server, node(s), a pool per route path and pool members.  Additionally, the Container Connector creates a layer 7 BIG-IP traffic policy and associates it with the virtual server.  This layer 7 traffic policy evaluates the hostname or URI path from the request and forwards the traffic to the pool associated with that path.

A **Route** points to a **Service** which points to one or more **Pods** where the application is running.

.. NOTE:: 

    All Route resources share two virtual servers:

    * **ose-vserver** for HTTP traffic, and
    * **https-ose-vserver** for HTTPS traffic

    The Container Connector assigns the names shown above by default. To set set custom names, define **route-http-vserver** and **route-https-vserver** in the BIG-IP Container Connector Deployment.  Please see the documentation at: http://clouddocs.f5.com for more details.

To complete this exercise, you will perform the following steps:

* Step 1: Deploy demo application and associated Service
* Step 2: Create a Route that defines routing rules based on hostname
* Step 3: Review the BIG-IP configuration

**Step 1:** Deploy demo application and its associated Service

In the previous exercise, you created the Deployment and Service separately. This step demonstrates creating both the Deployment and the Service from a single configuration file.  A separator of 3 dashes (``---``) is used to separate one resource definition from the next resource definition. 

From ose-master, review the following deployment: f5-demo-app-route-deployment.yaml

.. literalinclude:: ../../../openshift/advanced/apps/module3/f5-demo-app-route-deployment.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 2,20

Now that you have reviewed the Deployment, you need to actually create it by deploying it to OpenShift by using the **oc create** command:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 tmp]# oc create -f f5-demo-app-route-deployment.yaml -n f5demo
    deployment "f5-demo-app-route" created
    service "f5-demo-app-route" created

**Step 2:** Create OpenShift Route

In this step, you will create an OpenShift Route.

From ose-master server, review the following Route: f5-demo-app-route-route.yaml

.. literalinclude:: ../../../openshift/advanced/apps/module3/f5-demo-app-route-route.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 2

.. attention:: *Knowledge Check: How does the Container Connector know what application the Route refers to?*

Now that you have reviewed the Route, you need to actually create it by deploying it to OpenShift by using the **oc create** command:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 tmp]# oc create -f f5-demo-app-route-route.yaml -n f5demo
    route "f5-demo-app-route" created

**Step 3:** Review the BIG-IP configuration

In this step, you will examine the BIG-IP configuration for changes that occured after the the OpenShift Route was deployoed.

Using the Chrome browser, navigate to **Local Traffic --> Network Map** and change the partition to **ocp** using the dropdown in the upper right.

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-network-map-route.png
    :align: center

The network map view shows two virtual servers that were created by the Container Connector when it procssed the Route resource created in the previous step.  One virtual server is for HTTP client traffic and the other virtual server is for HTTPS client traffic.

To view the IP address of the virtual server, hover your cursor over the virtual server named **ocp-vserver**

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-route-vs-hover.png
    :align: center

.. attention:: *Knowledge Check: Which OpenShift resource type defines the names of the two virtual servers?*

Next, you will view the traffic policy that was created by the Container Connector when it processed the OpenShift Route.

Navigate to **Local Traffic --> Policies --> Policy List** and change the partition to **ocp** using the dropdown in the upper right.

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-route-policy-list.png
    :align: center

Click on the traffic policy listed uner **Published Policies** to view the policy page for the selected policy:

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-route-policy.png
    :align: center

Next, click on the rule name listed under the **Rules** section of the policy page to view the rule page for the selected rule:

.. warning:: Due to the version of TMOS used in this lab you will not see the correct "hostname" due to a GUI issue.

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-route-rule.png
    :align: center

On the rule page, review the configuration of the rule and note the match condition and rule action settings.

.. attention:: *Knowledge Check: Which OpenShift resource type defines the hostname to match against?*

**Step 5:** Test the application

In this step, you will use the Chrome browser to access the application you previously deployed.

Because the Route resource you created specifies a hostname for the path, you will need to use a hostname instead of an IP address to access the demo application.

Open a new Chrome browser tab and enter the hostname **mysite.f5demo.com** in to the address bar:

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/f5-demo-app-route.png
    :align: center

On the application page, the **Server IP** is the pool member (pod) IP address; the **Server Port** is the port of the virtual server; and the **Client IP** is the IP address of the Windows jumpbox you are using.

**Step 6:** Cleanup deployed resources

In this step, you will remove the Deployment, Service and Route resources you created in the previous steps using the OpenShift **oc delete** command.

From ose-master server, issue the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 tmp]# oc delete -f f5-demo-app-route-route.yaml -n f5demo
    route "f5-demo-app-route" deleted

    [root@ose-mstr01 tmp]# oc delete -f f5-demo-app-route-deployment.yaml -n f5demo
    deployment "f5-demo-app-route" deleted
    service "f5-demo-app-route" deleted

Exercise 3: Route - Blue/Green Testing
--------------------------------------

The F5 Container Connector supports Blue/Green application testing e.g testing two different versions of the same application, by using the **weight** parameter of OpenShift Routes.  The **weight** parameter allows you to establish relative ratios between application **Blue** and application **Green**. So, for example, if the first route specifies a weight of 20 and the second a weight of 10, the application associated with the first route will get twice the number of requests as the application associated with the second route.

Just as in the previous exercise, the F5 Container Connector reads the Route resource and creates a virtual server, node(s), a pool per route path and pool members.

However, in order to support Blue/Green testing using OpenShift Routes, the Container Connector creates an iRule and a datagroup on the BIG-IP. Troubleshooting handles the connection routing based on the assigned weights.

.. NOTE:: At smaller request volumes, the ratio of requests to the **Blue** application and the requests to the **Green** application may not match the relative weights assigned in the OpenShift Route.  However, as the number of requests increases, the ratio of requests between the **Blue** application and the **Green** application should closely match the weights assigned in the OpenShift Route.

To complete this exercise, you will perform the following steps:

* Step 1: Deploy version 1 and version 2 of demo application and their related Services
* Step 2: Create an OpenShift Route for Blue/Green testing
* Step 3: Review BIG-IP configuration
* Step 4: Test the application
* Step 5: Generate some request traffic
* Step 6: Review the BIG-IP configuration
* Step 7: Cleanup deployed resources

**Step 1:** Deploy version 1 and version 2 of demo application and their associated Services

From ose-master, review the following deployment: f5-demo-app-bg-deployment.yaml

.. literalinclude:: ../../../openshift/advanced/apps/module3/f5-demo-app-bg-deployment.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 2,4,36,38,59,61,93,95

Now that you have reviewed the Deployment, you need to actually create it by deploying it to OpenShift by using the **oc create** command:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 tmp]# oc create -f f5-demo-app-bg-deployment.yaml -n f5demo
    deployment "node-blue" created
    service "node-blue" created
    deployment "node-green" created
    service "node-green" created

**Step 2:** Create OpenShift Route for Blue/Green Testing

The basic Route example from the previous exercise only included one path.  In order to support Blue/Green application testing, a Route must be created that has two paths.  In OpenShift, the second (and subsequent) path is defined in the **alternateBackends** section of a Route resource.

From ose-master, review the following Route: f5-demo-app-bg-route.yaml

.. literalinclude:: ../../../openshift/advanced/apps/module3/f5-demo-app-bg-route.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 2,21,26,28,30

.. note:: How the Route resource refers to two different services: The first service is for the **Blue** application with a weight of 20 and the second service is for the **Green** application with a weight of 10.

.. attention:: *Knowledge Check: How many requests will the **Blue** application receive relative to the **Green** application?*

Now that you have reviewed the Route, you need to actually create it by deploying it to OpenShift by using the **oc create** command:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 module3]# oc create -f f5-demo-app-bg-route.yaml
    route "f5-demo-app-bg-route" created

Verify that the Route was successfully creating by using the OpenShift **oc get route** command.  Note that, under the **SERVICES** column, the two applications are listed along with their request distribution percentages.

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 tmp]# oc get route -n f5demo
    NAME                   HOST/PORT              PATH      SERVICES                         PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
    f5-demo-app-bg-route   mysite-bg.f5demo.com   /         node-blue(66%),node-green(33%)   80                      None

.. attention:: *Knowledge Check: What would the Route percentages be if the weights were 10 and 40?*

**Step 3:** Review BIG-IP configuration

In this step, you will examine the BIG-IP configuration for changes made by the Container Connector after the the OpenShift Route was deployoed.

Using the Chrome web browser, navigate to **Local Traffic --> Pools --> Pool List** and change the partition to **ocp** using the dropdown in the upper right.

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip01-route-bg-pool.png
    :align: center

.. note:: There are two pools defined: one pool for the **Blue** application and a second pool for the **Green** application. Additionally, the Container Connector also creates an iRule and a datagroup that the BIG-IP uses to distribute traffic based on the weights assigned in the OpenShift Route.

**Step 4:** Test the application

In this step, you will use the Chrome browser to access blue and green applications you previously deployed.

Because the Route resource you created specifies a hostname for the path, you will need to use a hostname instead of an IP address to access the demo application. 

Open a new browser tab and enter the hostname **mysite-bg.f5demo.com** in to the address bar:

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/f5-demo-app-bg-url.png
    :align: center

Refresh the browser periodically and you should see the web page change from the **Blue** application to the **Green** application and back to the **Blue** application as noted by the colors on the page.

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/f5-demo-app-blue.png
    :align: center

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/f5-demo-app-green.png
    :align: center

**Step 5:** Generate some request traffic

As the number of requests increases, the relative number of requests between the **Blue** application and the **Green** application begins to approach the weights that have been defined in the OpenShift Route.

In this step, you will use the Linux **curl** utility to send a large volume of requests to the application.

From the ose-master server, run the following command to make 1000 requests to the application:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 ~]# for i in {1..1000}; do curl -s -o /dev/null http://mysite-bg.f5demo.com; done

**Step 6:** Review the BIG-IP configuration

In the previous step, you used the **curl** utility to generate a large volume of requests.  In this step, you will review the BIG-IP pool statistics to see how the requests were distributed between the **Blue** application and the **Green** application.

Using the Chrome web browser, navigate to **Local Traffic -> Pools -> Statistics** and change the partition to **ocp** using the dropdown in the upper right.

.. image:: /_static/class5/module3/bigip-blue-green-pool-stats.png
    :align: center

**Step 7:** Cleanup deployed resources

In this step, you will remove the Deployment, Service and Route resources you created in the previous steps using the OpenShift **oc delete** command.

From ose-master server, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    [root@ose-mstr01 tmp]# oc delete -f f5-demo-app-bg-route.yaml -n f5demo
    route "f5-demo-app-bg-route" deleted

    [root@ose-mstr01 tmp]# oc delete -f f5-demo-app-bg-deployment.yaml -n f5demo
    deployment "node-blue" deleted
    service "node-blue" deleted
    deployment "node-green" deleted
    service "node-green" deleted
