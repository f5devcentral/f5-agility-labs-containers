Lab 3.1 - F5 Container Connector Setup
======================================

The BIG-IP Controller for Marathon installs as an
`Application <https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/application-basics.html>`_

.. seealso:: The official CC documentation is here:
   `Install the BIG-IP Controller: Marathon <http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/marathon/mctlr-app-install.html>`_

BIG-IP Setup
------------

To use F5 Container connector, you'll need a BIG-IP up and running first.

Through the Jumpbox, you should have a BIG-IP available at the following
URL: https://10.1.1.245

.. warning:: Connect to your BIG-IP and check it is active and licensed. Its
   login and password are: **admin/admin**

   If your BIG-IP has no license or its license expired, renew the license. You
   just need a LTM VE license for this lab. No specific add-ons are required
   (ask a lab instructor for eval licenses if your license has expired)

#. You need to setup a partition that will be used by F5 Container Connector.

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Via the CLI:
      tmsh create auth partition mesos

      # From the UI:
      Browse to System --> Users --> Partition List
      - Create a new partition called "mesos" (use default settings)
      - Click Finished

   .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-bigip-partition-setup.png

   With the new partition created, we can go back to Marathon to setup the
   F5 Container connector.

Container Connector Deployment
------------------------------

.. seealso:: For a more thorough explanation of all the settings and options see
   `F5 Container Connector - Marathon <https://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/marathon/>`_

Now that BIG-IP is licensed and prepped with the "mesos" partition, we need to
deploy our Marathon BIG-IP Controller, we can either use Marathon UI or use
the Marathon REST API.  For this class we will be using the Marathon UI.

#. From the jumpbox connect to the Marathon UI at http://10.2.10.21:8080 and
   click "Create Application".

   .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-create-application-button.png

#. Click on "JSON mode" in the top-right corner

   .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-json-mode.png

#. **REPLACE** the 8 lines of default JSON code shown with the following JSON
   code and click Create Application

   .. literalinclude:: ../marathon/f5-bigip-ctlr.json
      :language: json
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 9,14,15

   .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-create-f5-cc.png

#. After a few seconds you should have a new folder labeled “f5” as shown in
   this picture.

   .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-clickF5folder.png

#. Click on the “f5” folder and you should have "Running", the BIG-IP
   North/South Controller labeled marathon-bigip-ctrl.

   .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-f5-folder-shown.png

   .. note:: If you're running the lab outside of Agility, you need may need
      to update the field *image* with the appropriate path to your image:

      - Load it on **all your agents/nodes** with the docker pull command.
        **sudo docker pull f5networks/marathon-bigip-ctlr:latest** for the
        latest version.
      - Load it on a system and push it into your registry if needed.
      - If your Mesos environment use authentication, here is a link explaining
        how to handle authentication with the Marathon BIG-IP Controller:
        `Set up authentication to your secure DC/OS cluster
        <http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v1/marathon/mctlr-authenticate-dcos.html#mesos-authentication>`_

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you need to troubleshoot your container, you have two different ways to
check the logs of your container, Marathon UI or Docker command.

#. Using the Marathon UI Click on Applications --> the f5 folder -->
   marathon-bigip-ctlr. From here you can download and view the logs from the
   text editor of choice.

   You should see something like this:

   .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-logs.png

#. Using docker log command: You need to identify where the Controller is
   running. From the previous step we can see it's running on 10.2.10.22
   (which is **mesos-agent1**).

   .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-locate-bigip-controller.png

   Connect via SSH to **mesos-agent1** and run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo docker ps

   This command will give us the Controllers Container ID, here it is:
   4fdee0a49dcb. We need this ID for the next command.

   .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-get-bigip-ctlr-container-id.png

   To check the logs of our Controller:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo docker logs 4fdee0a49dcb

   .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-check-logs-bigip-ctlr.png

#. You can connect to your container with docker as well:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo docker exec -it 4fdee0a49dcb /bin/sh

      cd /app

      ls -la

      exit
