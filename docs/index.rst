Welcome to the F5 Agility Container Lab Documentation!
======================================================

The purpose of these labs is to give you better understanding of...

- **Kubernetes with F5 Container Ingress Service (CIS)**

  - Introduction to Kubernetes
  - How to install and use F5 CIS
  - How to launch a web server and use NodePort configuration

- **OpenShift with F5 Container Ingress Service (CIS)**

  - Introduction to OpenShift
  - How to install and use F5 CIS
  - How to launch a web server and use ClusterIP configuration

- **Using F5 Application Services 3 (AS3)**

  - Quick intro to consuming a full declarative JSON API programming interface
    to build F5 objects

- **Don't worry if you have never heard of NodePort or ClusterIP**

  - We will cover each method, and you are free to use either for your
    enterprise
  - For lack of time we only selected one method per each lab so you can
    understand the differences

- **Lastly - due to a shortened 2 hour lab, the "Appendix" tab (on the left)**
  **contains**

  - An intro to Docker, steps to build a Kubernetes cluster, how to deploy
    CIS to Mesos / Marathon
  - Don't forget F5 PD has many hours of reference material over at
    https://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/
