Welcome to the F5 Agility Container Lab Documentation!
======================================================

The purpose of these labs is to give you better understanding of...

- Kubernetes with F5 Container Ingress Service (CIS)
   - Introduction to Kubernetes
   - How to install and use F5 CIS
   - How to launch a web server and use NodePort configuration

- OpenShift with F5 Container Ingress Service (CIS)
   - Introduction to OpenShift
   - How to install and use F5 CIS
   - How to launch a web server and use ClusterIP configuration

- Using F5 Application Services 3 (AS3)
   - Quick intro to consuming a full declarative JSON API programming interface to build F5 objects

- Don't worry if you have never heard of NodePort or ClusterIP
   - We will cover each method, and you are free to use either for your enterprise
   - For lack of time we only selected one method per each lab so you can understand the differences

- Lastly - due to a shortened 2 hour lab, the "Appendix" tab (on the left) contains
   - An intro to Docker, steps to build a Kubernetes cluster,  how to deploy CIS to Mesos / Marathon
   - Don't forget F5 PD has many hours of reference material over at https://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/
