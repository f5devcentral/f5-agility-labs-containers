Lab 1.2 - F5 Container Connector Usage
======================================

Now that our container connector is up and running, let’s deploy an application and leverage our F5 CC.

App Deployment
--------------

From the jumphost connect to the Marathon UI on `http://10.2.10.10:8080 <http://10.2.10.10:8080>`_ and click "Create Application".

  		:align: center

#. Click on "JSON mode" in the top-right corner

	.. image:: images/f5-container-connector-json-mode.png
  		:align: center

#. **REPLACE** the 8 lines of default JSON code shown with the following JSON code and click Create Application

	.. literalinclude:: ../../../marathon/f5-hello-world-app.json
		:language: json
		:linenos:
		:emphasize-lines: 5,9,18,19,22

#. F5-Hello-World is "Deploying"

    .. note:: The JSON app definition specified several things:

        #. What container image to use (line 9)
        #. The BIG-IP configuration (Partition, VS IP, VS Port).
        #. The Marathon health check for this app. The BIG-IP will replicate those health checks.
        #. The number of instances (line 5)

    Wait for your application to be successfully deployed and be in a running state.

#. Click on "f5-hello-world". Here you will see two instance deployed, with their node IP and Port.

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-check-application-instance.png
        :align: center

#. Click on one of the <IP:Port> assigned to be redirect there:

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-access-application-instance.png
        :align: center

#. We can check whether the Marathon BIG-IP Controller has updated our BIG-IP configuration accordingly. Connect to your BIG-IP on https://10.1.1.245 and go to Local Traffic --> Virtual Server.

    .. warning:: Don’t forget to select the “mesos” partition or you’ll see nothing.
    
    You should have something like this:

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-check-app-on-BIG-IP-VS.png
        :align: center

#. Go to Local Traffic --> Pool --> "f5-hello-world_80" --> Members. Here we can see that two pool members are defined and the IP:Port match our deployed app in Marathon.

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-check-app-on-BIG-IP-Pool_members.png
        :align: center

#. You should be able to access the application. In your browser try to connect to http://10.2.10.81

Scale the application via Marathon
----------------------------------

We can try to increase the number of containers delivering our application. 

#. Go back to the Marathon UI (http://10.2.10.10:8080). Go to Applications --> "f5-hello-world" and click "Scale Application". 

    Let's increase the number from 2 to 10 instances and click on "Scale Application".

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-scale-application-UI.png
        :align: center

    Once it is done you should see 10 "healthy instances" running in Marathon UI.

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-scale-application-UI-10-done.png
        :align: center

    You can also check your pool members list on your BIG-IP.

    .. image:: images/f5-container-connector-scale-application-BIGIP-10-done.png
        :align: center

    As we can see, the Marathon BIG-IP Controller is adapting the pool members setup based on the number of instances delivering this application automatically.

#. Scale back the application to 2 to save ressources for the next labs
