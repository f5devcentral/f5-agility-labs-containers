Lab 1.1 - F5 Container Connector Setup
======================================

The official CC documentation is here: `Install the BIG-IP Controller: Marathon <http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/marathon/mctlr-app-install.html>`_

The BIG-IP Controller for Marathon installs as a Marathon `Application <https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/application-basics.html>`_

BIG-IP Setup
------------

To use F5 Container connector, you'll need a BIG-IP up and running first.

Through the Jumpbox, you should have a BIG-IP available at the following URL: https://10.1.1.245

.. warning:: Connect to your BIG-IP and check it is active and licensed. Its login and password are: **admin/admin**

    If your BIG-IP has no license or its license expired, renew the license. You just need a LTM VE license for this lab. No specific add-ons are required (ask a lab instructor for eval licenses if your license has expired)

#. You need to setup a partition that will be used by F5 Container Connector.

    .. code-block:: console

        From the CLI:
        tmsh create auth partition mesos

        From the UI:
        GoTo System --> Users --> Partition List
        - Create a new partition called "mesos" (use default settings)
        - Click Finished

Container Connector Deployment
------------------------------

.. note:: For a more thorough explanation of all the settings and options see `F5 Container Connector - Marathon <https://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/marathon/>`_

Now that BIG-IP is licensed and prepped with the "mesos" partition, we need to deploy our Marathon BIG-IP Controller, we can either use Marathon UI or use the Marathon REST API.  For this class we will be using the Marathon UI.

#. From the jumphost connect to the Marathon UI on `http://10.2.10.10:8080 <http://10.2.10.10:8080>`_ and click "Create Application".

	.. image:: images/f5-container-connector-create-application-button.png
  		:align: center

#. Click on "JSON mode" in the top-right corner

	.. image:: images/f5-container-connector-json-mode.png
  		:align: center

#. **REPLACE** the 8 lines of default JSON code shown with the following JSON code and click Create Application

	.. literalinclude:: ../../../marathon/f5-bigip-ctlr.json
		:language: json
		:linenos:
		:emphasize-lines: 9,14,15

#. After a few seconds you should have a 2nd application folder labeled “F5” as shown in this picture.

	.. image:: images/f5-container-connector-clickF5folder.png
  		:align: center

#.  Click on the “F5” folder and you should have running the BIG-IP North/South Controller labeled marathon-bigip-ctrl

	.. image:: images/f5-container-connector-f5-folder-shown.png
  		:align: center

	.. note:: If you're running the lab outside of Agility, you need may need to update the field *image* with the appropriate path to your image:

  		* Load it on **all your agents/slaves** with the docker pull command. **sudo docker pull f5networks/marathon-bigip-ctlr:latest** for the latest version.
  		* Load it on a system and push it into your registry if needed.
  		* If your Mesos environment use authentication, here is a link explaining how to handle authentication with the Marathon BIG-IP Controller: `Set up authentication to your secure DC/OS cluster <http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v1/marathon/mctlr-authenticate-dcos.html#mesos-authentication>`_

#. If you need to troubleshoot your container, you have two different ways to check the logs of your container:

	- Marathon UI
	- Docker command (By connecting to the relevant node. Here you'll need to identify which node is running the container)

	#. Using the Marathon UI

		- Click on Applications
		- Click on the f5 folder
		- Click on marathon-bigip-ctlr

		You should see something like this:

		.. image:: images/f5-container-connector-logs.png
  			:align: center

		From here you can download and view the logs from your text editor of choice.
	
	#. To check the logs with docker, you need to identify where the Controller is running. From the previous step we can see it's running on 10.2.10.40 (which is **f5-mesos-agent1**).

		.. image:: images/f5-container-connector-locate-bigip-controller.png
			:align: center

	#. Connect via SSH to **f5-mesos-agent1** and run the following commands:

		.. code-block:: console

  			sudo docker ps

		This command will give us the Controllers Container ID, here it is: 43c11f8d0cfa. We need this ID for the next few commands

		.. image:: images/f5-container-connector-get-bigip-ctlr-container-id.png
  			:align: center

	#. To check the logs of our Controller:

		.. code-block:: console

  			sudo docker logs 43c11f8d0cfa

		.. image:: images/f5-container-connector-check-logs-bigip-ctlr.png
  			:align: center

	#. To connect to our container with a Shell:

		.. code-block:: console

   			sudo docker exec -i -t 43c11f8d0cfa /bin/sh
