Node setup
==========

Once the master is setup and running, we need to connect our *nodes* to it.


Join the master
---------------

to join the master we need to run the command highlighted during the master initialization. In our setup it was:

::

	sudo kubeadm join --token=62468f.9dfb3fc97a985cf9 10.1.10.11


the output should be like this :

	:align: center


to make sure that your *nodes* have joined, you can run this command on the *master*:

::

	 kubectl get nodes

You should see your cluster (ie *master* + *nodes*)

Check that all the services are started as expected (run on the **master**):

::

	kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

.. image:: /_static/cluster-setup-guide-node-setup-check-services.png
	:align: center

Here we see that some weave net containers keep restarting. This is due to our multi nic setup. Check this link: `Deploying Kubernetes 1.4 on Ubuntu Xenial with Kubeadm <https://dickingwithdocker.com/deploying-kubernetes-1-4-on-ubuntu-xenial-with-kubeadm/>`_

You can validate this by connecting to a node and check the logs for the relevant container

to fix this, you need to run the following command on the **master**:

::

	sudo apt-get install -y jq

	kubectl -n kube-system get ds -l 'component=kube-proxy' -o json | jq '.items[0].spec.template.spec.containers[0].command |= .+ ["--cluster-cidr=10.32.0.0/12"]' | kubectl apply -f - && kubectl -n kube-system delete pods -l 'component=kube-proxy'

	:align: center
	:scale: 50%

Once this is done, you may check that everything is in a stable "Running" state:

::

	kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

.. image:: /_static/cluster-setup-guide-node-setup-check-all-ok.png
	:align: center

If you want to enable Kubernetes UI, you may install the dashboard. Run the following command on the **master**

First download a copy of the YAML file to deploy the dashboard.
::

	wget https://git.io/kube-dashboard-no-rbac -O kube-dashboard-no-rbac.yml

Modify the service to be type NodePort

::

	spec:
	  ports:
	  - port: 80
	    targetPort: 9090
	  type: NodePort
	  selector:
	    k8s-app: kubernetes-dashboard

Now run

::

	kubectl create -f kube-dashboard-no-rbac.yml

You should see the following output:

::

	deployment "kubernetes-dashboard" created
	service "kubernetes-dashboard" created

to access the dashboard, you need to see on which port it is listening. You can find this information with the following command (on the **master**):

::

	kubectl describe svc kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system

.. image:: /_static/cluster-setup-guide-check-port-ui.png
	:align: center

Here we can see that it is listening on port: 31578 (NodePort)

We can now access the dashboard by connecting to the following uri http://<master IP>:31578
