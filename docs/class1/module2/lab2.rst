Container Connector Usage
=========================

Now that our container connector is up and running, let's deploy an application and leverage our CC.

The environment already has a container called f5-demo-app already loaded as an image (Application provided by Eric Chen - F5 Cloud SA). It is available via docker hub - chen23/f5-demo-app

To deploy our front-end application, we will need to do the following:

#. Define a deployment: this will launch our application running in a container
#. Define a ConfigMap: ConfigMap can be used to store fine-grained information like individual properties or coarse-grained information like entire config files or JSON blobs. It will contain the BIG-IP configuration we need to push
#. Define a Service: A Kubernetes *service* is an abstraction which defines a logical set of *pods* and a policy by which to access them. expose the *service* on a port on each node of the cluster (the same port on each *node*). Youâ€™ll be able to contact the service on any <NodeIP>:NodePort address. If you set the type field to "NodePort", the Kubernetes master will allocate a port from a flag-configured range **(default: 30000-32767)**, and each Node will proxy that port (the same port number on every Node) into your *Service*.

App Deployment
--------------

On the **master** we will create all the required files:

Create a file called my-frontend-deployment.yaml: ---> Please use the file in /home/ubuntu/f5-demo

::

	apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
	kind: Deployment
	metadata:
	  name: my-frontend
	spec:
	  replicas: 2
	  template:
	    metadata:
	      labels:
	        run: my-frontend
	    spec:
	      containers:
	      - image: "chen23/f5-demo-app"
	        env:
	        - name: F5DEMO_APP
	          value: "frontend"
	        - name: F5DEMO_BACKEND_URL
	          value: "http://my-backend/"
	        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
	        name: my-frontend
	        ports:
	        - containerPort: 80
	          protocol: TCP

Create a file called my-frontend-configmap.yaml:    ---> Please use the file in /home/ubuntu/f5-demo

::

	kind: ConfigMap
	apiVersion: v1
	metadata:
	  name: my-frontend
	  namespace: default
	  labels:
	    f5type: virtual-server
	data:
	  schema: "f5schemadb://bigip-virtual-server_v0.1.2.json"
	  data: |-
	    {
	      "virtualServer": {
	        "frontend": {
	          "balance": "round-robin",
	          "mode": "http",
	          "partition": "kubernetes",
	          "virtualAddress": {
	            "bindAddr": "10.1.10.81",
	            "port": 80
	          }
	        },
	        "backend": {
	          "serviceName": "my-frontend",
	          "servicePort": 80
	        }
	      }
	    }

Create a file called my-frontend-service.yaml:   ---> Please use the file in /home/ubuntu/f5-demo

::

	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Service
	metadata:
	  name: my-frontend
	  labels:
	    run: my-frontend
	spec:
	  ports:
	  - port: 80
	    protocol: TCP
	    targetPort: 80
	  type: NodePort
	  selector:
	    run: my-frontend

We can now launch our application :

::

	kubectl create -f my-frontend-deployment.yaml

	kubectl create -f my-frontend-service.yaml

	kubectl create -f my-frontend-configmap.yaml


.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-launch-app.png
	:align: center


to check the status of our deployment, you can run the following commands:

::

	kubectl get pods -n default

	kubectl describe svc -n default

.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-check-app-definition.png
	:align: center
	:scale: 50%

Here you need to pay attention to:

	* the NodePort value. That is the port used by Kubernetes to give you access to the app from the outside. Here it's 32402
	* the endpoints. That's our 2 instances (defined as replicas in our deployment file) and the port assigned to the service: port 80

Now that we have deployed our application sucessfully, we can check our BIG-IP configuration.

.. WARNING::

   Don't forget to select the "kubernetes" partition or you'll see nothing


.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-check-app-bigipconfig.png
	:align: center

.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-check-app-bigipconfig2.png
	:align: center
	:scale: 50%


Here you can see that the pool members listed are all the kubernetes nodes.

Now you can try to access your application via your BIG-IP VIP: 10.1.10.81 :

.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-access-app.png
	:align: center
	:scale: 50%

Hit Refresh many times and go to your **BIG-IP** UI, go to Local Traffic > Pools > Pool list > my-frontend_10.1.10.81_80 > Statistics to see that traffic is distributed as expected

.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-check-app-bigip-stats.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

How is traffic forwarded in Kubernetes from the <node IP>:32402 to the <container IP>:80 ? This is done via iptables that is managed via the kube-proxy instances:

On **any nodes** (master/nodes), run the following command:

::

  sudo iptables-save | grep my-frontend

This will list the different iptables rules that were created regarding our frontend service.
