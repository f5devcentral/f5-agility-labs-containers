Container Connector(CC) Setup
=============================

the official CC documentation is here: `Install the F5 Kubernetes BIG-IP Controller <http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v1/kubernetes/kctlr-app-install.html>`_

BIG-IP setup
------------

To use F5 Container connector, you'll need a BIG-IP up and running first.

Through the Jumpbox, you should have a BIG-IP available at the following URL: https://10.1.10.60

.. WARNING::

   Connect to your BIG-IP and check it is active and licensed. Its login and password are: **admin/admin**

.. NOTE::

	 If your BIG-IP has no license or its license expired, renew the license. You just need a LTM VE license for this lab. No specific add-ons are required (ask a lab instructor for eval licenses if your license has expired)

You need to setup a partition that will be used by F5 Container Connector.

To do so go to : System > Users > Partition List. Create a new partition called "kubernetes"

Once your partition is created, we can go back to Kubernetes to setup the F5 Container connector

Container Connector deployment
------------------------------

Here we consider you have already retrieved the F5 container connector image and loaded it in the environment.

.. NOTE::

   If you haven't loaded it in your environment, you have two choices :

   #. load it on **all your systems** with the docker load -i <file_name.tar>
   #. load it on a system and push it into your registry

Now that our container is loaded, we need to define a deployment: `Kubernetes deployments <https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/deployments/>`_ and create a secret to hide our bigip credentials. `Kubernetes secrets <https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/secrets/>`_

On the **master** , we need to setup a deployment file to load our container and also setup a secret for our big-ip credentials

.. NOTE::

	 You can access it by running PUTTY in the RDP session, a session is already setup there

	 .. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-launch-ssh.png

To setup the secret containing your BIG-IP login and password, you can run the following command:

::

	kubectl create secret generic bigip-login --namespace kube-system --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=admin

you should see something like this:

create a file called ``f5-cc-deployment.yaml``. Here is its content: ---> Please use the file in /home/ubuntu/f5-demo

.. code-block:: yaml

        apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: k8s-bigip-ctlr-deployment
          namespace: kube-system
        spec:
          replicas: 1
          template:
            metadata:
              name: k8s-bigip-ctlr
              labels:
                app: k8s-bigip-ctlr
            spec:
              containers:
                - name: k8s-bigip-ctlr
                  image: "f5networks/k8s-bigip-ctlr:1.0.0"
                  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
                  env:
                    - name: BIGIP_USERNAME
                      valueFrom:
                        secretKeyRef:
                          name: bigip-login
                          key: username
                    - name: BIGIP_PASSWORD
                      valueFrom:
                        secretKeyRef:
                          name: bigip-login
                          key: password
                  command: ["/app/bin/k8s-bigip-ctlr"]
                  args: [
                    "--bigip-username=$(BIGIP_USERNAME)",
                    "--bigip-password=$(BIGIP_PASSWORD)",
                    "--bigip-url=10.1.10.60",
                    "--bigip-partition=kubernetes",
                    "--namespace=default"
                  ]



.. NOTE::

   You can use the templates on your jumpbox desktop or the Kubernetes Master under /honme/ubuntu/f5-demo. If you use those files, you'll need to :

	 * check the container image path in the deployment file is accurate
	 * Update the "bindAddr" in the configMap for an IP you want to use in this blueprint.

If you have issues with your yaml and syntax (**identation MATTERS**), you can try to use an online parser to help you : `Yaml parser <http://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator>`_

Once you have your yaml file setup, you can try to launch your deployment. It will start our f5-k8s-controller container on one of our node (may take around 30sec to be in a running state):

::

	kubectl create -f f5-cc-deployment.yaml

	kubectl get deployment k8s-bigip-ctlr-deployment --namespace kube-system

.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-launch-deployment-controller.png
	:align: center

FYI, To locate on which node the container connector is running, you can use the following command:

::

	kubectl get pods -o wide -n kube-system

.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-locate-controller-container.png
	:align: center

We can see that our container is running on the nodes

If you need to troubleshoot your container, you have two different ways to check the logs of your container:

	1. via kubectl command (recommended - easier)
	2. by connecting to the relevant node and use docker command. Here you'll need to identify on which node it runs and use docker logs command:

If you want to use kubectl command: you need to use the full name of your pod as showed in the previous image and run the command kubectl logs k8s-bigip-ctlr-deployment-<id> -n kube-system

::

	 kubectl logs k8s-bigip-ctlr-deployment-710074254-b9dr8 -n kube-system

.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-check-logs-kubectl.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

If you want to use docker logs command

On Node1 (or another node depending on the previous command):

::

	sudo docker ps

.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-find-dockerID--controller-container.png
	 :align: center

Here we can see our container ID: 7a774293230b

Now we can check our container logs:

::

	sudo docker logs 7a774293230b

.. image:: /_static/f5-container-connector-check-logs-controller-container.png
	 :align: center


You can connect to your container with kubectl also:

::

	 kubectl exec -it k8s-bigip-ctlr-deployment-710074254-b9dr8 -n kube-system  -- /bin/sh

	 cd /app

	 ls -lR

	 exit
