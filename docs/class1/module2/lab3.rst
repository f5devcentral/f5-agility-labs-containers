Lab 2.3 - Deploy Hello-World Using ConfigMap w/ AS3
===================================================

Just like the previous lab we'll deploy the f5-hello-world docker container.
But instead of using the Ingress resource we'll use ConfigMap.

App Deployment
--------------

On **kube-master1** we will create all the required files:

#. Create a file called ``deployment-hello-world.yaml``

   .. tip:: Use the file in ~/agilitydocs/docs/class1/kubernetes

   .. literalinclude:: ../kubernetes/deployment-hello-world.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :caption: deployment-hello-world.yaml
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 2,7,20

#. Create a file called ``clusterip-service-hello-world.yaml``

   .. tip:: Use the file in ~/agilitydocs/docs/class1/kubernetes

   .. literalinclude:: ../kubernetes/clusterip-service-hello-world.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :caption: clusterip-service-hello-world.yaml
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 2,8-10,17

#. Create a file called ``configmap-hello-world.yaml``

   .. tip:: Use the file in ~/agilitydocs/docs/class1/kubernetes

   .. literalinclude:: ../kubernetes/configmap-hello-world.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :caption: configmap-hello-world.yaml
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 2,5,7,8,27,30

#. We can now launch our application:

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl create -f deployment-hello-world.yaml
      kubectl create -f clusterip-service-hello-world.yaml
      kubectl create -f configmap-hello-world.yaml

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-launch-app-clusterip.png

#. To check the status of our deployment, you can run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl get pods -o wide

   .. image:: ../images/f5-hello-world-pods-clusterip.png

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl describe svc f5-hello-world

   .. image:: ../images/f5-cis-describe-clusterip2-service.png

   .. attention:: To understand and test the new app pay attention to the
      **Endpoints value**, this shows our 2 instances (defined as replicas in
      our deployment file) and the flannel IP assigned to the pod.

#. Now that we have deployed our application sucessfully, we can check the
   configuration on BIG-IP1. Switch back to the open BIG-IP1 TMUI management session.

   .. warning:: Don't forget to select the proper partition. Previously we
      checked the "kubernetes" partition. In this case we need to look at
      the "**AS3**" partition. This partition was auto created by AS3 and named
      after the Tenant which happens to be "**AS3**".

   Browse to: :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Virtual Servers`

   Here you can see a new Virtual Server, "**serviceMain**" was created,
   listening on **10.1.1.4:80** in partition "*AS3*".

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-check-app-bigipconfig-as3.png

#. Check the Pools to see a new pool and the associated pool members.

   Browse to: :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Pools` and select the
   "**web_pool**" pool. Click the Members tab.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-check-app-pool-cluster-as3.png

   .. note:: You can see that the pool members IP addresses are assigned from
      the overlay network (**ClusterIP mode**)

#. Access your web application via **Firefox** on the **superjump**.

   .. note:: Select the "**Hello, World**" shortcut or type **http://10.1.1.4** in the
      URL field.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-access-app.png

#. Hit Refresh many times and go back to your **BIG-IP** UI.

   Browse to: :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Pools --> Pool list -->
   "web_pool" --> Statistics` to see that traffic is distributed as expected.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-container-connector-check-app-bigip-stats-cluster-as3.png

   .. note:: Why is all the traffic directed to one pool member? The answer can
      be found by instpecting the "serviceMain" virtual service in the
      management GUI.

#. Scale the f5-hello-world app

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl scale --replicas=10 deployment/f5-hello-world-web -n default

#. Check that the pods were created

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl get pods

   .. image:: ../images/f5-hello-world-pods-scale10.png

#. Check the pool was updated on BIG-IP1. Browse to: :menuselection:`Local Traffic
   --> Pools` and select the "web_pool" pool. Click the Members tab.

   .. image:: ../images/f5-hello-world-pool-scale10-as3-clusterip.png

   .. attention:: Now we show 10 pool members. In Module1 the number stayed at
      3 and didn't change, why?

#. Remove Hello-World from BIG-IP.

   .. attention:: In older versions of AS3 a "blank AS3 declaration" was
      required to completely remove the application/declaration from BIG-IP. In
      AS3 v2.20 and newer this is no longer a requirement.

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl delete -f configmap-hello-world.yaml
      kubectl delete -f clusterip-service-hello-world.yaml
      kubectl delete -f deployment-hello-world.yaml

   .. note:: Be sure to verify the virtual server and "AS3" partition were
      removed from BIG-IP.

#. The next modules are **OPTIONAL**. If instructed to skip be sure to exit
   your current SSH session with **kube-master1** first. Then click here to
   start `Class 2: OpenShift with Container Ingress Service
   <../../class2/class2.html>`_. Otherwise click "Next" below.

   .. code-block:: bash

      exit
