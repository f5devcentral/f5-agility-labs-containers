Recap of Kubernetes and additional links
========================================

This Kubernetes lab came from open source code on Github, Docker, Ubuntu, and was originally created by F5 Solution Architects and F5 PD.  This was updated to a RavelloSystems BluePrint to support multiple container deployments during summer 17' for the F5 Agility event.  This lab will be updated fall 2017 for RedHat Openshift 3.6, please reach out to this team or your local F5 System Engineer for updated lab.
