F5 ASP and kube-proxy Deployment
================================

To use ASP, we will need to add a Application Services Proxy(ASP) instance to Every Node

Every node in the cluster needs to run an instance of ASP. The steps below demonstrate how to use a Kubernetes ConfigMap and DaemonSet to run one Application Services Proxy per node and apply the same configurations to each ASP instance.

The DaemonSet ensures one Application Services Proxy runs per node in the Kubernetes cluster. The ConfigMap contains the configurations you want to apply to each ASP instance.

The first step will be to load the relevant F5 container images into our system. The ASP container image has been pulled  in our private registry.  Normally, you would retreive ASP from the Docker Store (requires account and accepting a EULA, freely distributed).

Official F5 ASP documentation can be found here: `Install the F5 Kubernetes Application Service Proxy <http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v1/kubernetes/asp-install-k8s.html>`_  and `Deploy the F5 Application Service Proxy with the F5 Kubernetes Prox <http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v1/kubernetes/asp-k-deploy.html>`_


Deploy ASP
----------

To deploy ASP, we will need to add the following configuration to our Kubernetes solution:

* A configmap: The ConfigMap contains the configurations you want to apply to each LWP instance.
* A daemonset: The DaemonSet ensures one Application Services Proxy runs per node in the Kubernetes cluster.


To setup those components, connect to the **master** and do the following:

create a yaml file called ``f5-asp-configmap.yaml`` and here is the content to copy/paste into it.  ---> Please use the file in /home/ubuntu/f5-demo

::

	kind: ConfigMap
	apiVersion: v1
	metadata:
	  name: f5-asp-config
	  namespace: kube-system
	data:
	  asp.config.json: |-
	    {
	      "global": {
	        "console-log-level": "info"
	      },
	      "orchestration": {
	        "kubernetes": {
	          "config-file": "/var/run/kubernetes/proxy-plugin/service-ports.json",
	          "poll-interval": 500
	        }
	      }
	    }



After the configmap file, we can setup the daemonset file. Create a file called ``f5-asp-daemonset.yaml`` and here is the content to copy/paste into it.  ---> Please use the file in /home/ubuntu/f5-demo

::

	apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
	kind: DaemonSet
	metadata:
	  name: f5-asp
	  namespace: kube-system
	spec:
	  template:
	    metadata:
	      labels:
	        name: f5-asp
	    spec:
	      hostNetwork: true
	      containers:
	        - name: proxy-plugin
	          image: "store/f5networks/asp:1.0.0"
	          args:
	            - --config-file
	            - /etc/configmap/asp.config.json
	          securityContext:
	            privileged: false
	          volumeMounts:
	          - mountPath: /var/run/kubernetes/proxy-plugin
	            name: plugin-config
	            readOnly: true
	          - mountPath: /etc/configmap
	            name: asp-config
	      volumes:
	        - name: plugin-config
	          hostPath:
	            path: /var/run/kubernetes/proxy-plugin
	        - name: asp-config
	          configMap:
	            name: f5-asp-config


Once our files are created, we can use them to create the relevant ConfigMap and Daemonset to start our ASP instances.

On the **master**, run the following commands:

::

	kubectl create -f f5-asp-configmap.yaml

	kubectl create -f f5-asp-daemonset.yaml

Here the ASP should be deployed automatically. You should have as many ASP instances launched as kubernetes systems you have in your kubernetes cluster (in the Ravello blueprint, there are three - 3). You can validate this with the following commands:

::

	kubectl get pods -n kube-system

.. image:: /_static/class1/f5-asp-and-kube-proxy-deploy-asp.png
	:align: center

There should be three entries in the table returned by the command above that start with "f5-asp-".  The ASP instances are deployed. Now we need to update the kube-proxy with the F5-kube-proxy instances so that we can leverage our ASP.


Deploy f5-kube-proxy
--------------------

Right now, we have a Daemonset that is used to deploy the default kube-proxy. We will retrieve it to delete the existing instances.

To retrieve the kube-proxy daemonset config, run the following command to review its configuration:

::

	kubectl edit ds kube-proxy -n kube-system

It should launch a VI editor, save the configuration with the following command in vi :

::

	:w /tmp/kube-proxy-origin.yaml

Exit the VI editor with

::

	:q

Now, we can create our new daemonset to launch the F5-kube-proxy. create a new deamonset yaml called ``f5-kube-proxy-ds.yaml``

::

	vi  /tmp/f5-kube-proxy-ds.yaml

Here is the content of the file, copy/paste it.  ---> Please use the file in /home/ubuntu/f5-demo

::

	# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
	# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
	# reopened with the relevant failures.

Now that we have the legacy ds config and the updated one, we can delete the existing kube-proxy ds with the following command:

::

	kubectl delete -f /tmp/kube-proxy-origin.yaml

You can check that the kube-proxy instances have been removed from Kubernetes with the following command

::

	kubectl get pods -n kube-system

or

::

	kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

.. image:: /_static/class1/f5-asp-and-kube-proxy-delete-origin-kube-proxy.png
	:align:	center

Note that the entries starting with "kube-proxy-" in the table.

We can deploy the updated daemonset:

::

	kubectl create -f /tmp/f5-kube-proxy-ds.yaml

You can check that the deployment was successful with the command:

::

	kubectl get pods -n kube-system

.. image:: /_static/class1/f5-asp-and-kube-proxy-create-f5-kube-proxy.png
	:align: center
