Test our setup
==============

Our environment is setup. We can try our environment by deploying a large application built as micro services

We will use this application: `Micro services demo <https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo>`_


Connect to the **master** and run the following command:

::

	git clone https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo

	kubectl create namespace sock-shop

	kubectl apply -f microservices-demo/deploy/kubernetes/manifests


You can monitor the deployment of the application with the command:

::

	kubectl get pods -n sock-shop

.. image:: /_static/cluster-setup-guide-test-sock-shop-status.png
	:align: center

.. warning::

	The deployment of this application may take quite some time (10-20min)

Once all the containers are in a "Running" state, we can try to access our application. To access our application, we need to identify on which port our application is listening to. We can do so with the following command:

::

	kubectl describe svc front-end -n sock-shop

.. image:: /_static/cluster-setup-guide-test-sock-shop-find-IP.png
	:align: center

You can now access your application with the following URL: http://<master IP>:<NodePort>

.. image:: /_static/cluster-setup-guide-test-sock-shop-access-ui.png
	:align: center


You can also try to access it with the following URL: http://<Node1 IP>:<NodePort> , http://<Node2 IP>:<NodePort>
